## CoronavirusTracker

# Purpose
This project was created to explore my curiosity about web-scraping and apply it using the beautiful soup library. It's by no means a production-level project, it simply allowed me to explore data collection from 3rd party sources and play around with the visual representation of that data.

I take no credit for the original collection of this data â€“ all of my data comes from Danel Conlon at https://cov19.cc. As his website is updated, the script may not work as well and formatting may be a little off.


# Process
All information is scraped from https://cov19.cc using the beautiful-soup library then appended to the corona_data.csv data file.
